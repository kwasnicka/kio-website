# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: During my study at the Institute of Engineering Cybernetics, Wroclaw University of Technology, together with my husband, under the supervision of Prof. Roman Galar, we have initiated project on evolutionary processes modelling. That project ended by defending the Master Thesis focused on the application of so-called preadaptive principle to model evolutionary processes. Next years, as an assistant professor in the Futures Research Center, I have been engaged in research on forecasting methods and evolutionary computation at the beginning of my scientific career. In 1998 I moved to the Institute of Informatics, where currently I am a full professor. Over time, my interest has widened to nature-inspired methods, data mining, knowledge-based systems, and intelligent image analysis methods. Generating a hierarchy of groups of objects is the newest area of researches.
